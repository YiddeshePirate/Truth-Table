This is a command line program to take in logical statements and return a matching truth table

The logical operators it can handle are >: implies, |:or, ^: and, ~:not

Noted bugs are the inability to use imply multiple times without parentheses

Features I plan on adding include use of the <> operator and better error checking.

In the distant future I might add add tables with matplotlib
